            <ContentBlock title="Project Description">
              <p>
                Fuzion Chickasaw Group was engaged by the Generation organization
                and Corporate IT of a large electric utility to develop a
                comprehensive IT Project Charter and Azure DevOps (ADO) functional
                requirements framework for the Enterprise Project Management System
                (EPMS) program.
              </p>

              <p>
                The request was driven by a strategic evaluation effort involving
                multiple business units—including Generation, Operations, and
                Transmission & Distribution—along with Corporate IT leadership. The
                organization was assessing whether to continue investing in existing
                and evolving platforms, including internal construction and project
                management solutions, or to transition to alternative commercial
                SaaS platforms.
              </p>

              <p>
                To support this decision, Corporate IT requested a formal,
                defensible, and traceable documentation package detailing EPMS
                architecture, infrastructure, engineering workflows, and business
                processes that Fuzion had previously delivered and stabilized.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Solution Overview">
              <p>
                Fuzion developed a structured IT Project Charter and ADO-based
                requirements model that translated business objectives into both
                functional and non-functional system requirements. The effort
                enabled leadership to objectively compare existing platforms with
                alternative SaaS solutions under consideration, including
                large-scale enterprise construction and project management systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                The work emphasized governance, clarity, and testability, ensuring
                all requirements were measurable, traceable, and aligned with
                enterprise standards. By creating a consistent framework within
                Azure DevOps, the utility gained a more disciplined and defensible
                basis for strategic system evaluation.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Scope of Work & Capabilities">
              <p>
                Fuzion delivered a comprehensive documentation and analysis effort
                that included development of an EPMS IT Project Charter aligned
                with enterprise governance standards, documentation of current-state
                and future-state architecture and infrastructure, and mapping of
                engineering and business processes across Generation, Operations,
                and T&D.
              </p>

              <p>
                The engagement also included decomposition of business requirements
                into functional requirements, definition of non-functional
                requirements such as performance, security, scalability, and
                compliance, and structured functional decomposition into epics,
                features, and user stories within Azure DevOps.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fuzion established clear, testable acceptance criteria for each
                requirement, aligned requirements with project stage gates 1–5 and
                operational workflows, and created a structured ADO framework that
                supported objective vendor and platform comparison.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Business Impact">
              <p>
                This engagement enabled the utility to objectively evaluate
                enterprise SaaS alternatives against existing platforms while
                establishing a clear and traceable link between business needs and
                system functionality.
              </p>

              <p>
                The resulting framework reduced risk by ensuring requirements were
                explicit, measurable, and testable, while also supporting informed
                executive decision-making with defensible documentation. It gave the
                organization a clearer basis for comparing major platform options
                without relying on assumptions or incomplete business logic.
              </p>

              <p>
                The work also created a reusable ADO framework for future
                enterprise initiatives and helped align business units and
                Corporate IT around a shared understanding of system needs,
                priorities, and evaluation criteria.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Strategic Value">
              <p>
                By translating complex operational and engineering requirements
                into a structured ADO model, Fuzion provided the utility with a
                vendor-neutral decision framework. This approach enabled leadership
                to compare multi-million-dollar SaaS alternatives against
                internally developed and modernized platforms without bias,
                ambiguity, or reliance on vendor marketing claims.
              </p>

              <p>
                The engagement reinforced Fuzion’s role as a trusted advisor
                capable of bridging business strategy, engineering operations, and
                enterprise IT governance. Rather than focusing only on technical
                delivery, the work positioned Fuzion at the center of strategic
                technology evaluation and investment planning.
              </p>

            <ContentBlock title="Why This Matters">
              <p>
                This project highlights Fuzion’s ability to support enterprise
                technology investment decisions in regulated utility environments,
                translate business strategy into actionable and testable technical
                requirements, and lead cross-functional alignment across multiple
                business units and Corporate IT.
              </p>

              <p>
                It also demonstrates Fuzion’s strength in applying disciplined
                requirements engineering and governance practices at scale, helping
                organizations make high-value technology decisions with greater
                confidence, clarity, and structure.
