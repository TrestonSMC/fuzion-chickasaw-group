              <p>
                Fuzion Chickasaw Group was engaged by the Generation organization
                of a large electric utility to assume responsibility for the
                assessment, stabilization, and ongoing support of a legacy
                Enterprise Project Management System (EPMS). The application supports
                multiple business units—including Generation, Operations, and
                Transmission & Distribution—and is heavily utilized during seasonal
                outage planning and execution.
              </p>

              <p>
                EPMS was originally developed to replace manual project tracking
                processes and supports end-to-end project lifecycle management from
                Stage Gate 1 through Stage Gate 5, including long-range forecasting,
                accounting integration, and interfaces with the utility’s financial
                business office. Due to its long evolution, limited documentation,
                and the retirement of the original developer, the system presented
                elevated operational and support risks.
              </p>

              <p>
                In late 2022, utility leadership formally classified EPMS as a
                business-critical enterprise application. Business stakeholders
                expressed concerns regarding continuity of support, system knowledge
                gaps, and responsiveness. Fuzion was requested to evaluate and
                execute a structured transition plan to stabilize and support the
                application while defining a long-term modernization roadmap.

                <span className="font-semibold text-black/85">Objective:</span>{" "}
                Establish full system transparency, reduce operational risk, and
                enable informed decision-making.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fuzion executed a comprehensive EPMS IT Discovery engagement under
                an accelerated timeline. Despite less than six weeks of execution
                time, Fuzion delivered a complete technical and operational
                assessment that included application architecture and infrastructure
                documentation, data flows and integrations, codebase assessment and
                supportability analysis, security and performance review, operational
                risk identification, and structured knowledge transfer documentation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The effort was completed on schedule, with an executive-level
                readout delivered to corporate IT leadership. The final delivery
                included over{" "}
                <span className="font-semibold text-black/85">

                , significantly improving governance, auditability, and long-term
                support readiness.

            <ContentBlock title="Parallel Support Activities">
              <p>
                During the discovery phase, Fuzion also provided targeted support
                for a critical EPMS integration initiative involving the utility’s
                asset management system, ensuring continuity of operations and
                minimizing business disruption.

            <ContentBlock title="Phase 2: Business Process Mapping">
              <p>
                Following IT discovery, Fuzion partnered with Generation leadership
                to perform enterprise business process mapping, documenting how EPMS
                supports operational workflows across departments. This phase helped
                align system capabilities with real-world business practices and
                identified process inefficiencies impacting schedule, forecasting,
                and execution.

            <ContentBlock title="Phase 3: Stabilization, Break/Fix, and Enhancements">
              <p>
                Based on findings from discovery and process mapping, Fuzion
                provided ongoing break/fix support and prioritized enhancements
                while developing a structured remediation and modernization plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Key activities included architecture and infrastructure remediation,
                controlled change and release management, ServiceNow-based incident
                and request tracking, Power BI reporting and analytics, and Six
                Sigma–driven governance and performance monitoring.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fuzion partnered with Veracity Consulting Inc., a qualified
                technology partner, to augment delivery capacity and ensure
                continuity.

            <ContentBlock title="Current State & Forward Roadmap">
              <p>
                Fuzion continues to support EPMS operations in collaboration with
                utility IT leadership. A forward-looking roadmap has been defined to
                evolve the platform toward a{" "}

                architecture, enhancing forecasting, reporting, and operational
                resilience.
              </p>

              <p>
                This approach enables the utility to extend the life of a
                mission-critical system, reduce dependency on costly COTS
                replacements, preserve business-specific functionality, and improve
                governance, supportability, and scalability.

                This engagement stabilized a business-critical enterprise
                application, eliminated institutional knowledge gaps, improved
                auditability and governance, reduced operational and support risk,

              <p>
                This engagement demonstrates Fuzion’s ability to assume
                responsibility for undocumented, mission-critical legacy systems,
                operate effectively in regulated and high-risk utility
                environments, deliver under aggressive timelines, bridge gaps
                between business operations and IT, and create modernization paths
                without disrupting core operations.
