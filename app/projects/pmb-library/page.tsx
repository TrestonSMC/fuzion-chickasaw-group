                Fuzion Chickasaw Group was engaged by the Generation organization
                of a large electric utility to design and implement a centralized
                Project Management Basis (PMB) SharePoint Library to support
                enterprise-wide project execution and governance.
              </p>

              <p>
                The PMB platform was created to serve as a single source of truth
                for Generation project management practices, consolidating project
                management processes, Stage Gate 1–5 definitions, engineering
                standards, vendor and supplier specifications, and operational
                guidance into a secure, structured, and highly accessible Microsoft
                365 environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition, the platform provides documentation and reference
                materials for the internal and external software applications used
                by project managers to plan and execute major outages during spring
                and fall operating cycles.

            <ContentBlock title="Scope of Work & Capabilities">
              <p>
                Fuzion delivered a comprehensive Microsoft 365–based solution that
                included the design and deployment of a Generation-wide PMB
                SharePoint Library, structured metadata and taxonomy to support
                search, governance, and reporting, and role-based security aligned
                with project managers, engineers, Owner’s Engineers, and leadership.
              </p>

              <p>
                The platform centralized documentation for project management
                processes and the full Stage Gate 1–5 lifecycle, while also
                organizing engineering standards and vendor and supplier
                specification libraries into a more governed and accessible
                environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                Fuzion also implemented reference documentation for internal and
                external project management and outage tools, custom dashboards and
                reporting for visibility and consistency, Power Apps–based forms to
                standardize submissions and updates, and Power Automate workflows
                to support approvals and process automation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The solution was further strengthened through Microsoft Teams
                collaboration integration and AI Copilot enablement to improve
                content discovery, user productivity, and long-term usability
                across the Generation organization.

            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Business Impact">
              <p>
                The PMB Central Hub enabled the Generation organization to
                standardize project management practices across complex capital and
                outage projects while reducing reliance on disconnected documents
                and tribal knowledge.
              </p>

              <p>
                It improved accessibility to critical project guidance, engineering
                standards, and specifications, while strengthening collaboration
                between project managers, engineers, Owner’s Engineers, and
                leadership through a centralized and governed digital environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                The platform also established a scalable governance foundation
                aligned with Microsoft 365 best practices, giving the organization a
                more structured and sustainable model for project execution and
                operational consistency.

            <ContentBlock title="Strategic Roadmap & Future Integration">
              <p>
                The PMB platform was intentionally designed as part of a broader
                enterprise vision to integrate multiple Generation systems into a
                single Microsoft 365 Central Hub and Dataverse, including the Alarm
                Response Management Library, Project Management Basis (PMB) Library,
                Engineering Standards Library (ESL), Project Definition Library
                (PDL), Generation Document Management Portal (GDMP), and the
                enhanced Enterprise Project Management System (EPMS).
              </p>

              <p>
                This future-state architecture is intended to deliver a unified user
                experience for project managers, engineers, Owner’s Engineers,
                management, and executive leadership—driving increased productivity,
                improved decision-making, and long-term scalability without reliance
                on costly third-party platforms.

            <ContentBlock title="Why This Matters">
              <p>
                This project highlights Fuzion’s ability to design enterprise-grade
                collaboration platforms for regulated utilities, apply Microsoft 365
                and Power Platform technologies to improve governance and execution,
                and support complex Generation and outage-driven project
                environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                It also demonstrates Fuzion’s ability to deliver solutions that
                align immediate tactical needs with long-term enterprise
                architecture, helping clients build scalable operational systems
                that support both current execution and future modernization.
