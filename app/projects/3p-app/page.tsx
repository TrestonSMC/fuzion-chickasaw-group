            <ContentBlock title="Project Description">
              <p>
                Fuzion Chickasaw Group was engaged by the Generation organization
                of a large electric utility to design and deliver a new 3P
                Lifecycle Management System (3P App)—a mission-critical platform
                responsible for governing all non-nuclear documents across the
                utility’s generation fleet.
              </p>

              <p>
                The 3P App was developed to replace fragmented, manual, and
                email-driven document governance processes with a structured,
                auditable, and role-based system that manages documents throughout
                their entire lifecycle. The platform supports the creation, review,
                approval, publication, and long-term maintenance of processes,
                procedures, and policies that are essential to safe and compliant
                generation operations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Designed and implemented within the utility’s Microsoft 365
                environment, the system established a scalable governance foundation
                for document lifecycle control while aligning to enterprise IT,
                cybersecurity, and compliance standards.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Solution Overview">
              <p>
                The 3P Lifecycle Management System provides a controlled governance
                framework that ensures documents are created consistently using
                approved templates, reviewed thoroughly by collaborators and formal
                reviewers, approved with documented authorization, and published and
                maintained through automated Biennial Review cycles.
              </p>

              <p>
                The system enforces controlled status transitions, automated routing,
                version integrity, and full audit traceability—supporting both
                regulatory compliance and internal policy standards. This created a
                much more disciplined, transparent, and defensible process for
                managing critical documentation across generation operations.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Scope of Work & Capabilities">
              <p>
                Fuzion delivered a comprehensive Microsoft 365–based solution that
                included the design and development of a custom Power Apps–based 3P
                Lifecycle Management application, structured intake forms, automated
                document number assignment, standardized document naming, and strict
                version control enforcement.
              </p>

              <p>
                The platform also introduced role-based workflows supporting
                Drafters, Collaborators, Reviewers, Approvers, and Administrators,
                along with automated actionable email notifications integrated with
                Outlook and Microsoft Teams. Controlled review, reroute, and approval
                processes were implemented with permanent audit history to strengthen
                accountability and governance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Additional capabilities included centralized SharePoint document
                repositories with structured metadata, Power BI dashboards showing
                document status, cycle time, and compliance visibility, automated
                Biennial Review tracking and lifecycle rerouting, and user training
                materials supported by a comprehensive operational user guide.
              </p>

              <p>
                All components were implemented in full alignment with corporate IT
                standards and cybersecurity policies within the utility’s Microsoft
                365 tenant.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Business Impact">
              <p>
                The 3P Lifecycle Management System enabled the Generation
                organization to centralize governance of all non-nuclear processes,
                procedures, and policies while improving accountability and
                transparency across the full document lifecycle.
              </p>

              <p>
                The solution eliminated manual tracking, email-driven approvals, and
                inconsistent standards that had previously slowed reviews and created
                governance gaps. In doing so, it strengthened audit readiness,
                improved the utility’s regulatory compliance posture, and supported
                more consistent document governance across the entire generation
                fleet.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond immediate operational improvements, the platform established a
                scalable foundation for long-term digital governance and positioned
                the organization to manage controlled documentation with greater
                efficiency, visibility, and structure.
              </p>
            </ContentBlock>

            <ContentBlock title="Strategic Alignment & Future Vision">
              <p>
                The 3P App was built to integrate with the Generation organization’s
                broader Microsoft 365 ecosystem, including the Engineering Standards
                Library (ESL), Plant Document Library (PDL), Project Management Basis
                (PMB) Library, Alarm Response Management Library, Generation Document
                Management Portal (GDMP), and the enhanced Enterprise Project
                Management System (EPMS).
              </p>

              <p>
                Together, these platforms form the foundation of a future Microsoft
                365 Central Hub and Dataverse, delivering a unified, role-based
                experience for engineers, project managers, Owner’s Engineers,
                leadership, and executive stakeholders.
              </p>

              <p>
                This broader alignment ensures that the 3P platform is not operating
                as a standalone tool, but as part of a larger digital governance and
                operational modernization strategy across Generation.

            <ContentBlock title="Why This Matters">
              <p>
                This project highlights Fuzion’s ability to deliver enterprise-grade
                governance platforms for regulated utilities, design role-based and
                auditable workflows that support compliance and risk management, and
                apply Microsoft 365 and Power Platform technologies at enterprise
                scale.
              </p>

              <p>
                It also demonstrates Fuzion’s ability to modernize legacy governance
                processes without introducing costly third-party systems—creating
                practical, scalable solutions that align with the client’s existing
                enterprise environment.
