                Fuzion Consulting Group and Fuzion Chickasaw Group continue to

                <strong className="text-black">Summer 2019</strong>, FCG365
                Fieldworks has evolved into a mature, secure, and scalable SaaS
                solution supporting complex project and program environments
                across regulated industries.
              </p>

              <p>
                FCG365 Fieldworks is designed to support all project and program
                stakeholders involved in construction and engineering
                initiatives—from field teams and engineers to project managers,
                Owner’s Engineers, and executive leadership. The platform can
                manage both small and large-scale projects, providing secure,
                role-based access, workflow automation, reporting, and AI-enabled
                capabilities within the Microsoft ecosystem.
