                Fuzion Consulting Group and Fuzion Chickasaw Group are actively
                developing <strong className="text-black">ProjectWorks™</strong>,
                a fully integrated Project Information Management System (PMIS)
                designed to modernize how complex projects and programs are
                planned, governed, and executed in regulated and enterprise
                environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                ProjectWorks builds upon Fuzion’s extensive experience supporting
                mission-critical enterprise project management platforms for large
                utility and infrastructure organizations. The new solution reflects
                real-world operational behaviors, workflows, and governance models
                proven in production systems—while introducing the latest
                AI-enabled capabilities and a refreshed, intuitive user experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                Designed as a cloud-native AI SaaS solution, ProjectWorks can be
                deployed within Fuzion’s Microsoft 365 or AWS tenants, with
                enterprise-grade security, scalability, and fully supported SLA
                models. The platform will support organizations managing both small
                initiatives and large, multi-year programs, delivering consistency
                across planning, execution, governance, and reporting.

              <p>
                Many of the core capabilities have been informed by Fuzion’s
                multi-year support of a business-critical Enterprise Project
                Management System (EPMS) used across Generation, Operations, and
                Transmission &amp; Distribution domains—now reimagined using modern
                AI, cloud, and automation technologies.

            <ContentBlock title="Built by Practitioners, Not Just Developers">
              <p>
                ProjectWorks is being developed by Fuzion’s diverse team of
                business, engineering, and technology experts who have spent years

                platforms under real operational pressures.
              </p>

              <p>
                This practitioner-led approach ensures the solution remains
                practical, scalable, and aligned with how projects are actually
                executed—not just how software is typically designed.
